production=false

progress=false


# What these settings do:
# production=false:

# Tells npm that this is a development environment, not production
# Ensures that development dependencies will be installed
# If set to true, npm would skip installing devDependencies
# progress=false:

# Disables the progress bar during package installation
# Makes npm output cleaner, especially in CI/CD environments or when logging npm activity
# Purpose of .npmrc:
# It allows you to define npm configurations at the project level
# Settings in this file override global npm configurations for this specific project
# It helps ensure consistent behavior across different development environments
